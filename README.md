Slot machine assignment for CMP104 Programming with C++

The repository contains the code for a simple slot machine game which runs within the Windows command line. 

The player starts with a total of 100 coins and each spin deducts 10 coins from their account. Pressing the Spacebar button will start the game and the slots will spin. The user should then press Spacebar multiple times to stop each column. 
The slots will change their colour based on the combination of symbols and their location. This will also add coins to the player's account. 

The game also has the option to slow down all columns or gradually increase their speed, the fastest being the last one.
